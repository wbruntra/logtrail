# Development Plan: Logtrail Application

This document outlines the steps to build a web-based log monitoring application.

## ✅ Phase 1: Core File Monitoring Service & API (COMPLETED)

1.  **File Watching Module:**
    - ✅ Create a Node.js module that can watch a given file for changes, specifically for new lines being appended.
    - ✅ This module will be the core of the real-time monitoring feature.

2.  **Log Simulation Script:**
    - ✅ Develop a script to periodically append new lines to `test/log.txt`. This will serve as a mock log generator for testing purposes.

3.  **Express.js Streaming API:**
    - ✅ Set up an Express.js server with an endpoint like `/api/logs/stream`.
    - ✅ This endpoint will use Server-Sent Events (SSE) to stream file changes to the connected client.
    - 🔄 Implement a configuration mechanism to define a list of monitorable log files for security and clarity.

## ✅ Phase 2: Basic Frontend React Application (COMPLETED)

1.  **Real-time Log Viewer:**
    - ✅ Implement a component to display the log stream.
    - ✅ Use the `EventSource` API to connect to the backend's streaming endpoint and display the data as it arrives.

2.  **Basic UI:**
    - ✅ Create a simple interface to display streaming logs.

## 🚀 Phase 3: Configuration Management & Multi-File Support

1.  **Configuration System:**
    - ✅ Create a configuration file (YAML) to define available log files
    - ✅ Include file paths, display names, and (optionally) descriptions
    - ⏳ Implement hot-reload of configuration changes

2.  **File Selection UI:**
    - ✅ Add a dropdown/selector to choose which log file to monitor
    - ⏳ Display file metadata (size, last modified, etc.)
    - ⏳ Show connection status for each monitored file

3.  **Multi-File Monitoring:**
    - ✅ Support simultaneous monitoring of multiple files (user can select any configured file)
    - ⏳ Implement tabbed interface or split-view for multiple logs
    - ⏳ Color-code or label different log sources

## 🎨 Phase 4: Enhanced User Experience

1.  **Log Formatting & Parsing:**
    - ✅ Implement log level detection (ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG)
    - ⏳ Add syntax highlighting for different log formats (JSON, structured logs)
    - ⏳ Support for timestamp parsing and formatting
    - ✅ Log output window is full width and soft wraps lines (no horizontal scroll)

2.  **Search & Filtering:**
    - ✅ Real-time search functionality across log content
    - ✅ Filter by log level, time range, or custom patterns
    - ✅ Regex support for advanced filtering

3.  **UI/UX Improvements:**
    - Professional styling with CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Material-UI)
    - Dark/light theme toggle
    - Responsive design for mobile devices
    - ✅ Auto-scroll toggle with manual scroll lock detection (floating pause/play button)

## 📊 Phase 5: Advanced Features

1.  **Historical Log Viewing:**
    - ✅ Load and display last N lines of log content (tail on file select)
    - ⏳ **Automatic History Loading on Scroll Up:**
      - **Frontend Implementation:**
        - Detect when user scrolls near the top of the log container (e.g., within 100px)
        - Maintain a "loading" state to prevent multiple simultaneous requests
        - Track current "offset" or "before" timestamp for pagination
        - When loading older logs, prepend them to the existing log array
        - Preserve scroll position after prepending (calculate and restore scroll offset)
        - Show loading indicator at the top when fetching older logs
        - Handle edge case when reaching the beginning of the file
      - **Backend Implementation:**
        - Create `/api/logs/history` endpoint with pagination parameters:
          - `file`: log file path
          - `before`: timestamp or line number to fetch logs before
          - `limit`: number of lines to return (default 100)
        - Implement efficient file reading that can start from a specific position
        - For large files, use file streaming with reverse reading or index-based approach
        - Return response with: `{ lines: [...], hasMore: boolean, nextBefore: "..." }`
        - Support both line-number-based and timestamp-based pagination
      - **Optimizations:**
        - Cache recently loaded chunks on frontend to avoid re-fetching
        - Implement virtual scrolling for very large log sets
        - Add debouncing to scroll events to prevent excessive API calls
    - ⏳ **Enhanced Pagination Controls:**
      - Add manual "Load More" button as fallback
      - Jump to specific timestamp or line number
      - "Go to beginning/end" buttons
    - ⏳ **File Position Tracking:**
      - Track current position in file (percentage, line number)
      - Show position indicator in UI
      - Persist position when switching between files

2.  **Log Analytics:**
    - Basic metrics dashboard (error rates, log frequency)
    - Pattern detection and alerts
    - Export functionality (filtered logs to file)

3.  **Performance Optimization:**
    - Virtual scrolling for large log volumes
    - Configurable buffer limits to prevent memory issues
    - WebSocket fallback for SSE connection issues

## 🔧 Phase 6: System Integration & Deployment

1.  **System Integration:**
    - Support for log rotation detection
    - Integration with common log formats (syslog, application logs)
    - Optional file permission validation

2.  **Security & Access Control:**
    - Basic authentication system
    - File access permissions and sandboxing
    - Rate limiting for API endpoints

3.  **Deployment & DevOps:**
    - Docker containerization
    - Environment-based configuration
    - Production build optimization
    - Health check endpoints

## 🚀 Phase 7: Advanced Monitoring Features

1.  **Alerting System:**
    - Pattern-based alerts (error keywords, thresholds)
    - Email/webhook notifications
    - Alert history and management

2.  **Distributed Logging:**
    - Support for remote log sources
    - Log aggregation from multiple servers
    - Central dashboard for multiple instances

3.  **Advanced Analytics:**
    - Log trend analysis
    - Performance metrics visualization
    - Custom dashboard creation
